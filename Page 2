Now check your own shelter to see if you have these features in your shelter. It is a good idea to have a door. You can chose a wooden door
or an iron door. Think about what door you want before you place it because zombies can break through wooden doors if your diffuculty is 
set to hard. Iron doors can not be broken by zombies. If you shoose a iron door put a button next to the door. If you press the button it 
will open the door. Another thing you should have is a bed. If you tap on a bed at night you will start sleeping. If you sleep then you 
skip the night and wake up the next morning. If your difficulty is not peaceful hostile mobs will spawn. Hostile mobs will atempt to kill 
you
