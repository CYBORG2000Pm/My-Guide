Now check your own shelter to see if you have these features in your shelter. It is a good idea to have a door. You can chose a wooden door
or an iron door. Think about what door you want before you place it because zombies can break through wooden doors if your diffuculty is
set to hard. Put a button next to the door. Another thing you should have is a bed. If you tap on a bed at night you will start sleeping. If you sleep then you skip the night
and wake up the next morning.
